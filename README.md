# Sui Flashloan Examples

This repository contains professional examples of flash loan implementations on the Sui blockchain. It demonstrates integration with various protocols and showcases real-world use cases for flash loans in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The examples are designed to be educational and to demonstrate technical proficiency with Sui blockchain development, particularly focusing on flash loan mechanics and DeFi integrations.

## What is Flash Loan Arbitrage?

Flash loan arbitrage is a trading strategy that:

1. Takes out an uncollateralized loan (a "flash loan")
2. Uses the borrowed funds to exploit price differences between exchanges
3. Repays the loan (plus fees) in the same transaction
4. Keeps the profit from the arbitrage

This requires no initial capital, making it accessible to anyone with the technical knowledge to implement it.

## Features

This repository demonstrates:

- Integration with real Sui blockchain protocols
- Implementation of flash loans with various DeFi protocols
- Professional TypeScript code structure and patterns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit and integration testing

## Included Examples

### 1. Navi Protocol Flash Loan

A complete implementation of a flash loan using the Navi Protocol. This example demonstrates:

- Connecting to the Navi Protocol
- Executing a flash loan transaction
- Handling the borrowed funds
- Repaying the loan in the same transaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sui-flashloan-examples.git
   cd sui-flashloan-examples
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables by copying the example file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your Sui wallet mnemonic and other configuration options.

### Running the Examples

#### Navi Protocol Flash Loan Example

Run the Navi Protocol flash loan example:

```
npm run navi:flashloan
```

This will execute a complete flash loan cycle using the Navi Protocol on the Sui blockchain.

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify the examples:

```
npm test
```

### Environment Variables

The examples use the following environment variables:

- `SUI_NETWORK`: The Sui network to connect to (`mainnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet`)
- `SUI_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL for the Sui network
- `SUI_MNEMONIC`: Your wallet mnemonic (12 or 24 words)
- `GAS_BUDGET`: Gas budget for transactions (default: 50000000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` for additional logging

Example `.env` file:
```
SUI_NETWORK=testnet
SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
SUI_MNEMONIC=your twelve word mnemonic phrase goes here
GAS_BUDGET=50000000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## About Navi Protocol

[Navi Protocol](https://naviprotocol.io/) is a leading lending protocol on the Sui blockchain that provides flash loan functionality. Flash loans allow users to borrow assets without collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction.

Key features of Navi Protocol:

- Uncollateralized flash loans
- Support for multiple tokens (USDC, USDT, WETH, etc.)
- Low fees
- Simple API for developers

For more information, visit the [Navi Protocol documentation](https://naviprotocol.gitbook.io/).

## Disclaimer

This repository contains examples for educational purposes. While the code demonstrates real integrations with blockchain protocols, it should not be used in production without proper review and risk management:

1. Always implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
2. Conduct thorough testing on testnet before mainnet deployment
3. Implement monitoring and alerting systems
4. Consider gas optimization for production environments
5. Secure sensitive information like private keys and mnemonics
