Add remote deployment templates and scripts

This commit adds template files for deploying the application to a remote server:

- Added template scripts for SSH setup and remote deployment
- Added a Docker Compose template for remote deployment
- Added a setup script to help users create their deployment scripts
- Updated .gitignore to exclude real deployment scripts with credentials
- Modified Dockerfile to fix TypeScript compilation issues
- Updated docker-compose.yml to expose health check port

These templates provide a secure way to deploy the application without
committing sensitive information like server addresses, usernames, or SSH keys.
Users can create their own deployment scripts from these templates by running
the setup-deployment-scripts.sh script and then updating the configuration
variables with their actual values.
